                        <p>There are hundreds of privately owned orphanages, charity organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations in Ethiopia, all housing, supporting, and tackling to reduce and prevent orphan children from being on the streets. Since the 1970s famine in Ethiopia, many international-based NGOs such as World Vision, Compassion International, Save the Children, and Path International have been interested in this particular matter. They have made it their mission to work on the lives of orphans. In recent decades, numerous local private orphanages have emerged and have successfully reduced orphan numbers and homeless youth prevention.
                            However, there is a major disconnection between community-based, local nonprofit organizations working with orphaned children and youth and the funders, sponsors, donors, or potential donors and sponsors. Many abroad Ethiopians and non-Ethiopians with the passion and heart for orphans wanting to help and donate to a good cause are often held back due to previous negative experiences or lack of trust, infrastructural issues, and underdeveloped virtual platforms–causing orphanages to miss out on the opportunity to have the capability and funding to successfully serve. As a result, orphanages in Ethiopia are often overcrowded and underfunded, making it difficult for them to provide adequate care and support for the children living there. Many of these children are forced to live in unsanitary and unhealthy conditions and often lack access to necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Additionally, the restrictions placed by the Ethiopian government on international adoption have caused foreign
                            sponsors and donors–to create a significant gap in local orphanages’ funding and resource access.</p>
